structr Android Client
======================

The classes in this repository enable your Android App to connect to a REST web service built with structr.

You can use structr-core and structr-rest to build a domain-specific REST API. structr is backed by the Neo4j graph database.

structr-android-client sports the following features:

- Asynchronous connectors to keep the user interface responsive while loading data in the background
- SSL support
- Serialization and deserialization with GSON
- Use @Expose annotation to map POJO fields to structr REST output
- t.d.c.

Please note that this software is early alpha status. Use carefully at your own risk.
